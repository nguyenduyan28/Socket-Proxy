# Socket Proxy Project  

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Socket Proxy, designed to act as an intermediary between clients and servers for routing and managing network traffic. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of socket programming, multi-threading, and network communication principles.  

## Features  

- **Proxy Functionality**: Acts as a bridge between clients and servers, relaying requests and responses.  
- **Socket Programming**: Implements low-level network communication using TCP/IP sockets in C++.  
- **Multi-Threading**: Handles multiple client connections simultaneously using threads for concurrency.  
- **Data Forwarding**: Efficiently forwards data packets between clients and target servers.  
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to detect and recover from common networking errors.  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/nguyenduyan28/Socket-Proxy.git  
   cd Socket-Proxy
2. Using the repository:
   ```bash
   python3/python proxyclient.py
